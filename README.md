# How to use AlFinder

##1) Downloading

### Instructions

Download ALL documents from https://github.com/tbigot/alFinder and save them in the same folder (e.g. NGS_analysis).
To perform this step, you can use git:

    git clone https://github.com/tbigot/alFinder.git

or the download link on this repository website.

### Requirements

Works on any system with [python](https://www.python.org/) available.

##2) Test the program with the example

First try the demonstration, located in the `example` folder of the previously created folder (e.g. `NGS_analysis`)


1. In the `example` folder the user can find an example based on the method described in the following article:
 > Large-scale genotyping by next generation sequencing: how to overcome the challenges to reliably genotype individuals?
 Ferrandiz-Rovira M, Bigot T, Allainé D, Callait-Cardinal M-P, Cohas A.
 * the file `data.fna` contains the output data from the sequencing machine
 * the file `tags.csv` contains the tags
 * the files `alleles_locus1.fas`, `alleles_locus2.fas`, `alleles_locus3.fas` and `alleles_locus4.fas` contain the previously described alleles for four loci
 * the file `correspondenceData.csv` contains the correspondence file
 * the `output_example` folder contains outputs from the example settings
 * the file `settings.ini` is modified according to the method described in the article and is ready to be use
 * the file `postprocessing.py` is modified according to the method described in the article and is ready to be use
2. Copy all the python files (`alFinder.py`, `individual.py`, `read.py`, `postprocessing.py`) to the example directory
3. Open the terminal (if python is not installed in your computer please download and install it on https://www.python.org/)
4. Use the command `cd` or `C:` depending on the operating system of your computer (linux/mac and Windows) to go in the directory where ALL downloaded documents have been saved (e.g. cd /home/NGS_analysis/example)
5. Call `alFinder.py` file in the terminal (type `python alFinder.py` in the terminal)
6. Call `postprocessing.py` file in the terminal (type `python postprocessing.py` in the terminal)
7. Close the terminal
8. You can find the results in the previously created folder (e.g. `NGS_analysis/example`)
    * the file `data_result.csv` is the obtained result after typing `python alFinder.py` in the terminal
    * the file `data_filteredResults.csv` is the obtained result after typing `python postprocessing.py` in the terminal
    * the files `intermediateResults` are generated after each step (see article)

    
##3) Use it with your own data
You run succesfully the example, now try it on your own data
1. Put your own data in the previously created folder (e.g. NGS_analysis):
 * a file with the output data from the sequencing machine
 * a file with the tags
 * a file/files with the previously described alleles (if no previously described alleles: an empty file should be present for each locus)
 * if necessary: the correspondence file
2. Modify `settings.ini` according to your needs, save and close it (see example in the `settings.ini` of the `example` folder)
3. Modifiy `postprocessing.py` according to your needs, save and close it (see example in the `postprocessing.py` of the `example` folder)
4. Open the terminal
5. Use the command `cd` or `C:` depending on the operating system of your computer (linux/mac and Windows) to go in the directory where ALL downloaded documents have been saved (e.g. `cd /home/NGS_analysis`)
6. Call `alFinder.py` file in the terminal (type `python alFinder.py` in the terminal)
7. Call `postprocessing.py` file in the terminal (type `python postprocessing.py` in the terminal)
8. You can find the results in the previously created folder (e.g. `NGS_analysis`)
